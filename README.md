# 323 JDBC Project
With the ease of communications that we enjoy today, it is much easier to collaborate on writing a book than ever. It is so easy in fact, that many authors have formed "writing groups". Each writing group has a unique name and a head writer.
You will form groups of two for this project. Your project should allow for interaction with the user so the user may specified the required data.
